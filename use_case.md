Merlin: Network Magic in a Kubernetes Cluser 
=====================================
This submission provides network engineers the ability to start using pyATS inside a Kubernetes Cluster. Merlin transforms pyATS learned functions and parsed commands into business-ready files (JSON, YAML, CSV, MD, HTML)

Using Kubetnetes we have created micro-services from each of these commands, and they automatically refresh evey minute using CronJobs in K8s!
